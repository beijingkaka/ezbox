Legend: Giant Quafoo Chases Sunny Boy
    Little Sunny Boy was having a great time riding in the sky with his mother. He did not notice there was a giant on the big mountain in the north who was staring at him. That giant was the kind-hearted Quafoo.
    Quafoo had a scary look because he wore two yellow snakes around his ears. Quafoo was stroking his chin and wondering about the dark dots on the face of Sunny Boy. He was so naive that he thought Sunny Boy had forgotten to wash his face after eating. He decided to go and remind Sunny Boy to clean his face.
    Putting thoughts into action, Quafoo got up and began his giant strides towards Sunny Boy. Just when Sunny Boy was merrily singing his favorite songs in the six-dragon wagon, he saw a giant with snakes around the ears come striding towards him. Sunny Boy got so scared that he started to cry. His tears fell on the earth and caused a big storm in broad daylight. Mother Shehe also got nervous, not knowing what this giant was after. She frantically drove the six-dragon wagon away as fast as she could.
    Quafoo the Giant was so big that his strides soon were catching up with the six-dragon wagon. Just as he was getting close, Shehe ordered the dragons to blow fire on him. The fierce fire gave Quafoo a hot face and burned his hair. Quafoo wiped the sweat off his forehead and gave up his chase. He looked down and saw the Yellow River. He bent over and drank the Yellow River dry. But he was still hot and thirsty, so he strode over to the Wei River and drank it dry, too.
    Wiping his mouth clean, Quafoo mumbled to himself, "I only wanted to be nice and tell Sunny Boy that his face was dirty. But he wouldn't even listen to me. Well, forget it. I won't play with him anymore." Quafoo turned around and stumbled along back north. For he knew in the north there was a big swamp with plenty of water, and he still wanted to drink some more.
